Data-driven and mechanism-driven research should not be seen as opposites. Diverse datasets—whether from observations, reanalyses, or machine-learning products—can reveal patterns and anomalies that guide scientists toward important questions. Yet the crucial step lies beyond pattern recognition: it is the choice of methods to interrogate those patterns, the framing of hypotheses, and the effort to pursue the fundamental *“why.”*  

If research remains at the level of producing safe, tool-oriented answers, it may meet immediate needs but does little to move the field forward conceptually. True progress comes when data are not only used for description, but also mobilized to refine, challenge, and ultimately deepen our mechanistic understanding.
